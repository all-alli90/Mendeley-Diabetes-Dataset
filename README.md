# **Objective** #

The aim of this project is to combine the strength of three machine learning algorithms to enhance accuracy in classifying diabetes. This will be achieved by building a stacking ensemble model that combines Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors, with the goal of improving the model's ability to differentiate between non-diabetic, pre-diabetic and diabetic.

# **Content** #

### Mendeley Diabetes Dataset ###
  - Contains medical information for 1000 patients from the Medical City Hospital and The Specialized Center for Endocrinology and Diabetes-Al-Kindy Teaching Hospital in Iraq.
  - Has 14 attributes including demographic and clinical measurements such as age, gender, blood glucose levels, body mass index (BMI), cholesterol level, and other relevant health indicators.
  - Each patient is classified as either Diabetic, Non-Diabetic, or Pre-Diabetic.
